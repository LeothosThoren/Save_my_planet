# Save my planet
This project allow the consumers to scan products in order to detect palm oil
and help to prevent environmental disaster.

## Motivation
This app meets an urgent and serious need: to reduce the consumption of **palm oil**.
Thus the __*Save My Planet*__ application (which is inspired by [Yuka](https://yuka.io/) and [UFC Quel Cosm√©tique](https://www.quechoisir.org/application-mobile-quelcosmetic-n52804/)) helps consumers
to change their habits.
